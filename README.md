Vocal exercises for Performous
==========
This is a folder of very simple vocal exercises that can used with the free software Performous.
http://performous.org/

These are very basic exercises intended for 

* Beginners at singing
* "Tone deaf" people
* Following voice feminisation surgery or other kinds of voicebox surgery

Three exercises are suitable for some female and child voices and some higher male voices. 

(Good morning, How are you, and Thank you)

Good morning (lower register) is also provided an octave down suitable for some lower male voices. 

(All exercises can be done in any octave because Performous doesn't take into account register for scoring; however, it is easier for those who struggle with getting the correct pitch to try and match the exact pitch rather than sing an octave down or up.)

.mscz files are also included; these are not needed by Performous, however, they're the source for the .mp3 files and may be useful if you want to change the register of the exercises yourself.
